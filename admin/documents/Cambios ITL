Cambios pendientes: 

Front: 

Mostrar "Eventos" (El layout esta descuadrado) --> Hecho
Newsletter solamente con login --> Hecho
Mostrar "Newsletter" y "Factsheet" --> Factsheet, falta newsletter
Sistema de login en el frente --> Hecho
Revisar cual es el problema con el reloj en IE (IE6 - 8)

Back: 

The userlevel is ok now. --> Hecho

Things to change:

When I edit a user, the type is always set to "superadmin" even when the user is of type "Customer". Remove the type subscriber here.  --> Hecho

Things to add:

Now I need a "Contact Management" available to both superadmin & normal admin. When a user register, the data is saved in the table "contact". Don’t mix with "user". When the contact registers, the status is set to inactive (status = 0). The admin will activate the contact. When editing a contact, the admin user can activate the contact (use field "status = 1"). --> Hecho

In the table contact, there is a field "type". When user register from website, set this field to "1" which means "Website".  -> Hecho
